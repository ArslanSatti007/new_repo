IMPORTANT NOTE !!!  As I have implemented the complete architetcure for automation framework in this project. It will contain some empty python modules.
                    In this sample project I have automated two api test cases , so you will find implementaion files[feature, steps, logic] by looking directly into
                    following directories.
                    
                         i) auto_engine/tests/api/features/weather.feature
                        ii) auto_engine/tests/api/steps/test_weather_steps.py
                       iii) auto_engine/logic/api/weather_logic.py
