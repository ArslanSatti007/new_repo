You can see two parent directories named as [task_1] and [task-2] in this assignmnet

1) [task_1] directory contains a PDF file named [solution_task_1.pdf], which is the solution of task 1 in assignment

2) [task_2] directory contains three items. Two files [solution_task_2.pdf and test_cases_document.xlsx] and automation project [auto_proj_root]

      i) solution_task_2.pdf is PDF file which contains instructions about [test_cases_document.xlsx] and automation project [auto_proj_root]
     ii) [test_cases_document.xlsx] conatins the test cases documentations
    iii) [auto_proj_root] is the project which contains automation code. 
  
  
IMPORTANT NOTE !!!  As I have implemented the complete architetcure of automation framework this project [auto_proj_root]. This will contain some empty python modules.
                    I have explianed this BDD framework in detail in two of pdf files [solution_task_1.pdf,olution_task_2.pdf], Please refer to them.
                    In this assignment I have just automated two api test cases in this framework, so you will find three files[feature, steps, logic] by looking into
                    following directories.
                    
                         i) auto_engine/tests/api/features/weather.feature
                        ii) auto_engine/tests/api/steps/test_weather_steps.py
                       iii) auto_engine/logic/api/weather_logic.py
